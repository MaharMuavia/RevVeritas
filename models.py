"""Shared Pydantic models passed between RevVeritas agents.

Concept 2 (multi-agent): agents communicate with these structured objects, never
raw strings. A `Candidate` is a deterministic discrepancy; a `Verdict` is the
Gemini judgment; a `Finding` is the adjudicated result; a `LeakReport` is the
ranked output of an audit.
